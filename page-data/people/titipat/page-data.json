He completed his Ph.D. in Bioengineering at University of Pennsylvania with Konrad Kording working on applying natural language processing and machine learning to improve scientific processes. His interests are to combine NLP, ML, and tools to improve science itself. In extension to his core research, he also broadly interests in applying ML and NLP in biomedical and business domains in Thailand where he collaborate with multiple research groups and companies in Thailand pushing NLP and ML for real use cases.</p>\n<h2>Positions and previous work</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-founder of Neuromatch <a href=\"https://neuromatch.io/\">neuromatch.io</a></li>\n<li>Organizer of Neuromatch Conferences (NMC) <a href=\"https://conference.neuromatch.io/\">conference.neuromatch.io</a></li>\n<li>Online Co-chair at Asian Conference in Machine Leanring (ACML) 2021</li>\n<li>VISTEC-depa Thailand AI Research Institute <a href=\"https://airesearch.in.th/\">https://airesearch.in.th/</a></li>\n<li>Asian Conference in Machine Learning (ACML) workshop on Machine learning 2020 (see <a href=\"https://acml-conf.github.io/2020-workshop-ml-in-thailand/\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Outside research</h2>\n<p>Titipat actively write his blog posts in Thai at <a href=\"https://tupleblog.github.io/\">tupleblog</a>, contribute to open-source community (see <a href=\"https://github.com/titipata/\">github.com/titipata/</a>), answer questions on Stack Overflow (see <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3626961/titipata\">Stack Overflow</a>), and push local machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) communities in Thailand.
