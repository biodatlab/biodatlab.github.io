I am starting the\nlab by the end of 2021. I am thankful that I got the funding from <a href=\"https://www.cos.io/score\">COS and DARPA SCORE</a>\nwhich allows me to start the lab and hire people even before I start a position.\nMy interest still continue from my PhD which are applying machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP)\nto improve scientific processes. I will also expand my research more into NLP, and applied ML and NLP\nin biomedical domain. I put my current interests below:</p>\n<h2>Interests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Science of Science</strong>: one of my core research and interest is to make science and education better.\nI have collaborated with multiple conferences to implement ML and NLP tools to improve in this space.\nI co-founded Neuromatch conference and help with Neuromatch Summer School which aim to democratize\nhow scientists get access to conferences and proper computational trainings respectively.\nMoreover, I collaborate with the National Institute of Health (NIH) aiming to use NLP to better\nunderstand the funding process.</li>\n<li><strong>Thai Natural Language Prcessing</strong>: In extension to science of science, one of my long interest\nis to expand my research in Thai Natural Language Processing. Comparing to other languages,\nwe still have lack datasets and resources. Pushing on open source software, models, and datasets\nwill help push Thailand ML communities further. I hope that we should have useful tools that\nmost people can use when they have to analyze and understand Thai text.</li>\n<li><strong>Applied ML and NLP for biomedical use cases</strong>: Through my PhDs, I also collaborate with many people\nat Konrad's lab to apply computational approaches for human movements. I am collaborating with\nNidhi Seethapathi, Rachit Saluja, and others quite a bit in this space. There are a lot of opportunities\nthat we can apply ML for movement science which I would like to continue collaborating with experts\nin this area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Current projects</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Academic Trees (Science of Science)</li>\n<li>Scaling matching algorithms for Neuromatch (Science of Science)</li>\n<li>Credit assignments for reviewer network (Science of Science)</li>\n<li>Automatic exercise feedback (Biomedical)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Thought about starting the lab and collaborations</h2>\n<p>Thailand has some policy limitations and small funding landscapes. For example, they have\na policy to publish more papers before I can hire graduate students.\nAlthough, on the bright side, there are a lot of collaboration opportunities.\nI am grateful that a lot of people already support me moving\nto Mahidol University. This includes my PhD advisor Konrad Kording, Prof. Yodchanan Wongsawat (Mahidol),\nProf. Sarana Nutanong (VISTEC), and Prof. Attapol Rutherford (Chulalongkorn).\nAt least, I can hire students with them before I can receive students myself.\nI am also grateful that I have a really strong developer team including\nTulakan and Kittinan who started a blog with me and now join the lab as developers.\nThey help me a lot in multiple tasks.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>Next steps for me are probably to start hiring some more students and developers.\nI hope to train more researchers and developers directly from Thailand who\ncan make impact at large in the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 01, 2021","path":"/blog/moving-to-mahidol","title":"Starting the lab at Mahidol U","thumbnail":"/assets/blogs/poster.png","metaDescription":"Starting the lab at Mahidol University"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","440143384"]}
