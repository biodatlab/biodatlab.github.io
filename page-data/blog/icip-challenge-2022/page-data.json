Detecting such infections using traditional\ndiagnostic procedures requires experienced medical technologists together with a significant amount of time and effort.\nAn automated procedure with the ability to accurately detect parasitic diseases can accelerate the process greatly.\nHence, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based parasitic egg detection pipeline. We trained deep learning models using parasitic\negg detection and classification datasets provided by <a href=\"https://icip2022challenge.piclab.ai/\">ICIP Challenge 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>We are now rank 2 on the public leaderboard (see <a href=\"https://icip2022challenge.piclab.ai/leaderboard/\">here</a>) where we get an\nmIoU score of 92.946 and mF1Score of 98.633. The competition ends on May 31, 2022. Hopefully, we will rank on top 3 after the\ncompetition finishes! We will explain about the approaches we use on the paper and this blog post later on.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/assets/blogs/icip-2022.png\" width=400>\n  <br>\n  Example of the model prediction\n</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 02, 2022","path":"/blog/icip-challenge-2022","title":"ICIP 2022 - Parasitic Egg Detection and Classification","thumbnail":"/assets/blogs/icip-2022.png","metaDescription":"Our lab participate in ICIP challenge 2022, Parasitic egg detection and classification in microscopic images"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","440143384"]}
