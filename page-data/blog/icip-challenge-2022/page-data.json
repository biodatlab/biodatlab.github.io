Detecting such infections using traditional\ndiagnostic procedures requires experienced medical technologists together with a significant amount of time and effort.\nAn automated procedure with the ability to accurately detect parasitic diseases can accelerate the process greatly.\nHence, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based parasitic egg detection pipeline. We trained deep learning models using parasitic\negg detection and classification datasets provided by <a href=\"https://icip2022challenge.piclab.ai/\">ICIP Grand Challenge 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>Our solution got rank 3 at the competition happening at IEEE ICIP Conference in Bordeaux, France in October 2022.\nWe got an mIoU score of 92.946 and mF1Score of 98.633.
