This includes programming in Pytorch, basic terminologies (batch size, epoch, model architecture,\ngradient descent, optimizers, learning rate, scheduler). You can always consult\n<a href=\"https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html\">Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning course</a> if you want\nto cover some basic concepts in deep learning with code.</p>\n<p>Some topics are related to signal processing.\nSome of the concepts are well described in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7KLbd7n75g\">Steve Brunton</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViZYXxuxUKA\">Nathan Kutz</a> lectures. If you are interested in signal processing,\nfeel free to watch more videos there.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to learn together with all the lab members in this coming semester.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 12, 2022","path":"/resources/knowledge-sharing-fall-2022","title":"Knowledge sharing (Fall 2022)","thumbnail":"","metaDescription":"Knowledge sharing sessions at Biomedical and Data Lab, Fall 2022."}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","440143384"]}
