As most of incoming students may come from biomedical background,\nlearning some tools as you join the lab will be very useful later on. I listed some of the useful\ntools below:</p>\n<h2>Shell Script</h2>\n<p>Many times, we need it to run our scripts, move files, check files in directories, or updating packages.\nUnderstand shell scripts are very useful here. There are a lot of resources online where you can\nfind tutorials on shell scripts (Bash, Zsh, ...). I list some of them below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/bash\">devhints.io/bash</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bluebirz.net/1580/lets-play-bash-script/\">bluebirz.net tutorial on Bash</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version control</h2>\n<p>We generally use <code class=\"language-text\">git</code> as our version control and store many repositories on GitHub.\nHere, familiarize yourself with Git will help a lot in your code development.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tupleblog.github.io/use-git-part1/\">มาเริ่มใช้ Git กัน [part 1]</a> in Thai</li>\n<li>Linkedin Git Essential Training: The Basics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many more tutorials today. Make sure you know all the basic git terms such as add,\npull, fetch, merge, pull request.</p>\n<h2>Python</h2>\n<p>Python has been used in a lot of our development. Therefore, programming in Python is almost needed\nif you decide to join the lab. There are a lot of resources on how to learn Python. Try to\nlearn linear algebra, data science, and machine learning with some of the Python libraries such as\n<code class=\"language-text\">numpy</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">pandas</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">scikit-learn</code>.</p>\n<h2>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>\n<p>Today, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are a popular tools to build models in many projects.\nUnderstanding the basis of these tools are useful. Make sure that you learn the core concept of learning algorithms before applying\nto your project. There are multiple free online classes that you can learn ML and DL such as Andrew Ng's Machine Learning, <a href=\"https://academy.neuromatch.io/\">Neuromatch Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/\">Deep learning's book by Goodfellow and Bengio</a>,\nand more.</p>\n<h2>Recommended books</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science\">The Science of Science, by Albert-László Barabási and Dashun Wang</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48889983-calling-bullshit\">Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin D. West</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>... I will continue adding more resources to this page.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 01, 2021","path":"/resources/joining-the-lab","title":"Resources for incoming members","thumbnail":"","metaDescription":"Some resources before joining the lab"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","440143384"]}
